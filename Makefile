# Tell make we want to execute all commands using bash (otherwise it uses
# sh). make generally works best with bash, and as SHELL is inherited from the
# invoking shell when make is run, it may have a value like sh, tcsh, etc. If
# you don't do this, then some shell commands will not behave as you
# expect. This is in keeping with the principle of least surprise.

# In general, note that the order libraries are specified to the linker
# MATTERS. If a library is specified too early on the command line, which can
# happen when:
# 1. It is specified on the command line before the linker processes any
#    source files that contain references to it
# 2. It is specified on the command line with the libraries to link against
#    before another library that contains references to it.
#
# In both these cases the linker will "drop" the library and you will see
# unresolved reference errors.
#
# In general, you should put MORE general/base libraries at the end, and the
# libraries that depend on them BEFORE the base library. (i.e. link libglui
# before libmath via -lglui -lm).

# For graphics support, we also need to link with the Glut and OpenGL libraries.
