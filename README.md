# FlashPhoto

This was a semester long school project where I and two other students
created a an application called FlashPhoto, which is intended for 
basic image editing much like MS Paint. 

The application was built and tested with C++ on Ubuntu 16.04.

The other two students involved in the project were William Muesi,
(Meusi007@umn.edu) and Erik Husby (husby036@umn.edu). Some of the initial
files were originally authored by the courses teaching assistants.

## Building The Application

A makefile is provided that will build the application. It has the 
following build/clean commands:

  all             bin/FlashPhoto           The main executable
  clean           N/A                      Removes excutable, all .o
  veryclean       N/A                      Everything clean removes, +
                                           the external libraries
  bin/FlashPhoto  bin/FlashPhoto           The main executable
  documentation   Various                  Generates documentation for
                                           project from the doxygen
                                           comments/markup in the code
## Running The Application

The application can either be run from the executable generated by the
make in bin/FlashPhoto, or by the running 'make run'.
