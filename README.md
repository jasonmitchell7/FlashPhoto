# FlashPhoto

This was a semester long school project where I and two other students
created a an application called FlashPhoto, which is intended for 
basic image editing much like MS Paint. 

The application was built and tested with C++ on Ubuntu 16.04.

The other two students involved in the project were William Muesing,
(meusi007@umn.edu) and Erik Husby (husby036@umn.edu). Some of the initial
files were originally authored by the courses teaching assistants.

## Building The Application

A makefile is provided that will build the application. It has the 
following build/clean commands:

> ### make all
>
> Builds and links the libraries and the main executable

> ### make clean                      
> Removes the excutable and all *.o files

> ### make veryclean
> Cleans and removes and external libraries

## Running The Application

The application can either be run from the executable generated by the
make in bin/FlashPhoto, or by the running:

> ### make run
> Builds the application and libraries and runs the executable
